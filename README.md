# Overview
This program creates a vitual theatre and then fills this theatre full of patron. Its a basic concept of how theatre systems work just with an autofill file.

I updated my Eclipse and Now this program is broken

I wrote this software to demonstrate my ability with C++ 2 file concept.

[Software Demo Video] 
This program stopped working when I tried to make a video of it.

# Development Environment

I used Eclipse C++ IDE to create these file
Windows 10

Languages used are C++ and C

# Future Work
- Figure out why this code is breaking now
- Make it to where the user can choose a seat like in a theatre
- Add a display to show the seats available
